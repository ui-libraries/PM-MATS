  We are pleased to announce a significant milestone for the Principia Mathematica Maps and Table Site (PM-MATS). Over the past year, our team has expanded the structured dataset underpinning the global map and table, refined the visualization pipeline, and collaborated with scholars to integrate new materials from the second edition of <em>Principia Mathematica</em>.

  This release focuses on improving the clarity and navigability of complex citation networks, enhancing accessibility, and strengthening the editorial workflow that supports ongoing research. We also introduced new documentation and updated visual assets that make it easier to explore chapters, starred numbers, and proof relationships across volumes.

  We extend our gratitude to our project partners and contributors for their support. In the coming months, we will continue to refine the dataset, add educational materials, and develop new interactive features to support scholars, students, and the broader public.
